            <h1 class="pageHeader"><text>Dragons of Azeroth (WoW)</text></h1>
            
            <p>In world of Warcraft, Dragons started out as normal, intelligent, typically good creatures. 
                One dragon, named Galakrond, "The Father of Dragons", was a bloodythirsty terror to the 
                world. 5 dragons, along with a hero named Tyr, fought Galakrond and eventually defeated
                him. Impressed by the dragons and needing to leave Azeroth (the planet they live on), 
                The Titan Gods (the good gods) turned these 5 dragons into the dragon aspects
                to protect the world from other evils like Galakrond or the Old Gods (the evil gods).
                These 5 dragons are named Alexstrasza, Malygos, Nozdormu, Ysera, and Neltharion.
                Red, Blue, Green, Yello, and Black, respectively. There are some other types of dragons
                that are the result of breeding or corruption, but these are the original 5 flights.
                <br>
                These 5 flights since have worked together to keep harmony in Azeroth. However, unbeknownst to the other 4, 
                Neltharion became corrupted by the Old Gods. When a demon invasion to Azeroth threatened the destruction of their entire world (called the War 
                of the Ancients), Neltharion constructed a disk (called the Dragon Soul) that could save them all. He tricked the other 4 aspects to imbue 
                the Dragon Soul with some of their power, and then he used it to betray them and control them. In the end, Deathwing (as Neltharion was 
                now known) was defeated (but not destroyed quite yet).</p>
                <br><br>
                <div id="Alexstrasza" class="wowDragonTab">
                    <h1 class="wowDragonHeader">Alexstrasza and The Red Dragonflight</h1>
                    <p>Before leaving Azeroth, the Titan Eonar (patron of life) gave some of her power to the compassionate (yet fierce)
                            Alexstrasza, turning her into the red dragon aspect and the Dragonqueen. The Red Dragonflight, now led by Alexstrasza, 
                            serve to protect and nurture all life on Azeroth. Alexstrasza is known as 'The Lifebinder', 
                            and worked alongside many mortal heroes to defeat the evils in Azeroth for thousands of years
                             (evils such as the Lich King, Deathwing, or even some of the Old Gods).
                            <br>
                            Sadly, during the Second War between the human-elf-dwarf alliance and the orcish horde, the orcs 
                            found a way to enslave many red dragons. Alexstrasza herself was enslaved and mourned for the 
                            death of her children and the deaths they were forced to cause. Thankfully, a few red dragons got
                            away (especially one named Krasus by the mortals of the world) and came back later with help to free 
                            Alexstrasza and the majority of her flight from the orcs. Since then, the red dragonflight has used 
                            its fiery breath and destructive capability to safeguard all life on Azeroth and undo the destruction they caused while enslaved.
                            </p>

                <div id="Ysera" class="wowDragonTab">
                    <h1 class="wowDragonHeader">Ysera and The Green Dragonflight</h1>
                    <p> After giving Alexstrasza a great portion of her power, the Titan Eonar bestowed power to Ysera as well. To Ysera, she gave
                    a duty to watch over the wilds of Azeroth and the ethereal realm later known as "The Emerald Dream", making Ysera the green aspect. Ysera leads the green dragonflight 
                    in protecting the nature of Azeroth from Demons, the Old Gods, and all who sypathize with them. Ysera often joined Alexstrasza to defeat 
                    the evils of the world. Being bound to Emerald Dream caused her to eventually enter an endless trance, and since became known as "The 
                    Dreamer", though she could still appear (though incorporeal) and help the other dragons protect Azeroth. 
                    <br> 
                    The green dragonflight (and creatures of nature in general) entered a crisis when something corrupted the Emeral Dream, turning it into 
                    the Emerald Nightmare. From this corrupted realm, Ysera and lieutenants of her flight (so bound to the nightmare) committed acts of isolation and
                    bigotry, ordering the others of their flight to attack all not of the green dragonflight and to awaken some of the world's evils. With the help 
                    of a powerful druid named Malfurion, along with others, Ysera was eventually able to destroy the Emerald Nightmare and restore it to the 
                    Emerald dream. 
                    <br>
                    Ysera, after a cataclysm which shook the world, became "Ysera the Awakened", and helped the red, blue, and bronze dragonflights destroy deathwing.
                    Sadly, due to some time-line merging and too much to describe here, the Emerald Nightmare comes back and proves too much for Ysera this time. Those
                    who were instrumental in stopping the Emerald Nightmare end up succumbing to it along with Ysera. The green aspect now commanding an army of demons 
                    forces heroes (including a one Tyrande) to kill her and lay her suffering soul to rest. The rest of the green flight continues to take care of the
                    once-again restored Emerald Dream.

                    <h1 class="wowDragonHeader">Malygos and The Blue Dragonflight</h1>
                    <p> The Titan Norgannon (the titan master-magician and lore-keeper) gave Malygos a huge portion of his magic weilding power. 
                    Malygos later became known as the Spell-weaver and was charged with the protection of all arcane magic of the world. He too came to 
                    the aid of the other dragons as often as he could.
                    <br> 
                    During the War of the Ancients, Neltharion tricked Malygos first by playing to his pride, who then in turn was instrumental in 
                    convincing the other 3 aspects to give their power to the Dragon Soul. After Neltharion's betrayal, the aspects were losing the fight 
                    against now Deathwing. Malygos, in a last-ditch effort to stop Deathwing, commanded his flight to surround Deathwing in order to take the 
                    Dragon Soul (now called the Demon Soul) away from him. With but a simple command however, his entire flight was eradicated and Malygos was 
                    left alive, badly injured. Though the aspects were eventually successful, the injuries Malygos sustained, his guilt from encouragin the other 
                    aspects to create such a horrible artifact, and the loss of his entire flight caused him great grief and remorse. He eventually flew to his 
                    lair in the northern continent Northrend where he slowly went mad from the grief.
                    <br>
                    A member of the red dragonflight, Krasus, had gone to Malygos' lair to help. He took Malygos' remaining eggs and hid them away in a secret 
                    place. In a second battle with Deathwing (millenia later), the aspects and other heros (like Rhonin the mage) destroyed the Demon Soul 
                    and restored the aspects stolen power to them. With all her power, Alexstrasza was able to revive the eggs and grant Malygos a new dragonflight. 
                    Malygos gained some of his vitality of his former self back, but he was still insane. When his Nexus (a point of powerful magic, and the home of 
                    the blue dragons) was attacked by some nether dragons, he misunderstood their ramblings to mean that they were actually embodiments of the power 
                    of the Nexus. Malygos then absorbed them and their power, returning much of his sanity to his broken mind.
                    <br>
                    Malygos, with a newly sound mind, noticed how many mortals had begun to use Arcane magic in his long absense. Taking note of the recklessness of 
                    their use, and not wanting to repeat the war with the demon horde (it was misuse of arcane magic that brought them to Azeroth in the first place), 
                    Malygos declared war on all magic users. Using an artifact given him by Norannon, he redirected the ley-lines of the world to his home in Northrend.
                    This started to cause horrible, violent reactions in the world. He would not relent, however, and the 3 other aspects reluctantly decided he had to 
                    be stopped. In a horrible war between the blue dragonflight and the other three, Malygos was eventually killed. 
                    <br>
                    After the war, and a little bit of fighting as to who the new leader should be, Kalecgos is revealed to be the leader with the blue dragonflight's 
                    (and the world's) best interests in mind. He then leads the blue dragonflight in defending azeroth with the red, green, and bronze dragonflights.

                    <h1 class="wowDragonHeader">Nozdormu and The Bronze Dragonflight</h1>
                    <p> The Titan Aman'Thul, the oldest and wisest Titan, bestowed his power over time on Nozdormu and turned Nozdormu into the keeper of time and 
                    all the pathways of time and destiny. He became know as Nozdormu the Timeless. After the War of the Ancients, Nozdormu retreated into seclusion 
                    with his flight and rarely made appearances, even to help the other flights. Because of this, not much is really known about the bronze dragonflight.
                    However, what little the residents of Azeroth know is that they are good and continue to safeguard the flow of time for the good of Azeroth and all 
                    life.
                    <br>
                    During the great cataclysm caused by Deathwing, the bronze dragonflight was forced to be a much more present flight. Members of their flight from the future, led 
                    by a misintentioned Nozdormu from the future, try to destroy Azeroth in a misguided attempt to save the universe (a path that present-day Nozdormu can see will 
                    be the real cause of the universe's destruction). The present-day bronze dragonflight continues to win battles against the "Infinite dragonflight" (as the evil 
                    bronze dragons from the future call themselves), but Nozdormu is burdened with the sadness that one day his flight will cause much death and sadness to the 
                    people he strives to protect.

                    <p> The Titan Khaz'Goroth imbued Neltharion with his power of shaping and molding the world. Neltharion and his black dragonflight embodied strength and 
                    loyalty for millenia. Through his benevolence and grace, Neltharion gained the title of "The Earthwarder" as he shaped Azeroth for the benefit of the mortals 
                    who lived on it. 
                    <br>
                    Slowly, but surely, the Old Gods crept into Neltharion's mind as he spent more and more time in the earth of Azeroth (and therefor closer to their prisons). 
                    During the War of the Ancients, Neltharion's mind was completely corrupted. He chose that war to betray his former friends, almost destroyed them and the other denizens 
                    of Azeroth, and he and his flight spend the rest of their lives trying to carry out the will of the Old Gods and destroy all life on Azeroth. Neltharion's children 
                    are instrumental in the creation of many abominable dragon races and monsters, as well as the toppling of kingdoms and the orchestration of wars.
