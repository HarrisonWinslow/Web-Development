        An excerpt from Variaman Spadagenti's Study of Felindar:
        <br>
        "Dragons are cool. Undisputed. But though there does not exist a world without, 
        the varieties of Dragons vary greatly. On some worlds, the Dragons are little more 
        than animals, however large they may be. On some, Dragons are cleverer than mortals, 
        and rule through terror. In Felindar these magnificent beings hold many roles.
        <br>
        All Dragons on Felindar have the ability to shift between their Dragon form and 
        that of a Humanoid. Oftentimes Dragons will live among the mortals, gathering wealth 
        and playing in politics. Equally so, some Dragons spend their lives in the wildlands, 
        demanding tribute from the various tribes that they either protect or terrorize.
        <br>
        Most Dragons, however, spend their time together. Up North, above the Forests of Silk, 
        there is a large peninsula on which the Great Tribe has lived for centuries. Though there 
        are no manual laborers, there is a caste which uses magic to ensure the city is kept clean 
        and supplied.
        <br>
        There are several castes within the Great Tribe, mostly separated by lineage. The most 
        powerful include the House of Magic, the House of Shadows, and the House of Blood.
        <br>
        The House of Magic studies, well, magic. They search for ways to broaden the current understanding of such.
        <br>
        The House of Shadows trains its members in the arts of subterfuge. Anything from ‘how 
        to fit into a society’ to ‘how to topple a government’.
        <br>
        The House of Blood studies the more macabre magics of hemocraft. They consist mainly of Blood Hunters, 
        and those who style themselves as dark protectors of their world."
